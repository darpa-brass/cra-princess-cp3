#Tool for Generating Test Cases :

	Usage: python random_testcases.py $scenario $cluster_name > outputfile
	Ex: python random_testcases.py scenario0 AUSTIN1 > austin1.jl
	scenario : [baseline, scenario0, scenario1]
	cluster : All cluster in raw_data
	outputfile : JSON line format, each JSON object is a fully functional experiments data which can replace the "experiments.json"

This script gets a scenario/challenge type and a cluster name as input.  Based on the given scenario type, it changes the content in "test/data"

It randomly pick 5 pairs of stations in that cluster. For Scenario 0 and BaselineB, it randomly picks two months for training and one month for testing. For Scenario 1, it randomly picks four continuous months, first two for training and rest two for testing. Finally for each pair, it generates test cases for each sensor following "experiments.json" and puts all test cases to outputfile.

#Run the Tool:

	Usage: python test.py $testcases
	Ex: python test.py austin1.jl
	testcases : JSON line file which generated by "random_testcases.py"

This script reads the outputfile generated by "random_testcases.py", each line of this file is a JSON-format test case.

For each line, it replaces "experiments.json" with this line and modify the sensor name in "test/data". Then run ./start shell script. ./start runs "./create_files.sh" first, checks the training data and testing data, and runs "./run_scenario.sh".
