Steps to run the CP1 setup:
1. vagrant up
2. Start 2 different terminals and run vagrant ssh on both
3. On one vagrant ssh terminal:
     i. run "sudo startxfce4&" to start the xwindows.
     ii. open the terminal inside the xwindows.
     iii. run "/vagrant/eclipse/eclipse" to start eclipse on the xserver terminal.
     iv. import the evaluation project located at "/evaluation" under root dir.
     v. run  GrizzlyService (assuming the evaluation project is already compiled on the host system).
 4. On another vagrant ssh terminal:
     i. run "./start.sh" to run scenario0 and  scenario1 example scripts.
     ii. Results will be generated at /vagrant folder with files named, results_scenario0.csv and  results_scenario1.csv
