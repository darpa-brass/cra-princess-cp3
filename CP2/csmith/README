To build this, use ./dockerbuild.sh.

To run it, use ./dockerrun.sh [MASTER-SEED [NUMBER-OF-TESTS]]
This will generate the requested number of tests into the directory
corpus/, which should be empty or nonexistent beforehand.

The default master seed is 12345. The default number of tests is 100.

It will generate as many csmith outputs as it needs to produce the
requested number of accepted tests.

Note: for Docker reasons, your user-id inside and outside the Docker
container must be the same. Change the adduser command in the
Dockerfile accordingly to make a user inside the container with the
right uid.
