==== Alewife ====


Alewife is a declarative specification language.

We divide Alewife programs into four sections.

First, Alewife programs can declare types that are either grounded or
abstract.

We say that an Alewife type is grounded if it is of the type n bit or
n bit loc. A value V of grounded type T 'resolves' (forward ref) to a
cassiopeia value for all possible cassiopeia programs.

We say that an Alewife type is [floating, fish joke] abstract if it there
exists a valid cassiopeia program that cannot resolve the type.

Alewife currently has constructed record types, and may have ADTs, or
more likely, an explicit list type that can be constructed from either
a record type or a grounded type. The type system is still evolving
for non-grounded types.




First, Alewife programs declare predicates, which are uninterpreted
boolean valued pure functions. Second, programs declare 'functions'
which are t
