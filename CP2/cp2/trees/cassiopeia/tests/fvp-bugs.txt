ADD, page 309
This says that the carry and overflow bits are set, when in fact they are not.

AND, page 325
This says that the carry bit is set, when in fact it is not. Moreso, carry is undefined here.

LSL, page 469
This says that the carry bit is set, when in fact it is not.

LSR, page 473
This says that the carry bit is set, when in fact it is not.

Other bugs in arm-buggy.casp that don't have to do with the FVP:
* LSR resulting in 0 when the shift value is 0. This happens in v6, not v7.
* STR has a programmer error
