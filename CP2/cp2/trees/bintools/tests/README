sources - asm files used by the tests go here

singlefile - tests for single-file tools:
	as
	nm
	objdump
	size
	strip

multifile - tests for multi-file and library tools:
	ar/ranlib
	ld

This organization is because one has to run as to generate a .o file
before doing anything else (unless we save large numbers of .o files
in the repository, which creates a maintenance problem...) so we might
as well do that only once for each assembler source and then run all
the tools on it.

Meanwhile the multifile tools have enough in common to warrant a
separate framework.
