# page A2-46 contains important stuff about what happens when
# instructions address the PC directly.

# see ITSTATE operations on page A2-52

# writes to FPCSR do *not* incur hazards

# there are "checks" in ThumbEE that behave like branches
# (e.g. null pointer check) see page A2-96

# see "synchronization of changes to system control registers"
# on page B3-1461 and also page B5-1779

# multiple accesses to Device or Strongly-ordered memory by one insn 
# cannot span a 4k page boundary (page a3-138)

# we should enforce the stuff about IT thumb instructions matching the
# conditions on the instructions they govern; see A4.2.1 on page A4-162.
# and, uuugh, the encoding of some branches is affected by these (ibid)
