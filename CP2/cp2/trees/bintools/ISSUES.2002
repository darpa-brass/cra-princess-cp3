Known issues (bugs and/or missing features)
-------------------------------------------

- no shared library or PIC support whatsoever.

- no debugging symbol support whatsoever.

- the assembler cannot generate absolute symbols.

- strip doesn't exist/work.

- as and ld do not set the sh_info field of .symtab correctly.

- the ar operations that involve updating ar files will generate
  corrupt ar files.

- ranlib doesn't do anything (but ld doesn't require it, so it's
  ok except for interoperability)

- ld should probably handle filename symbols specially, but doesn't.

- ld leaks vast tracts of memory, but it doesn't matter too much.

- ld says it doesn't support the -N option, but it might work anyway.

- ld does not support the -S -s -X -x strip options.

- while I carefully crosschecked the linked hello-world binary by hand,
  and it all checked out, there are undoubtedly plenty of undetected
  bugs or non-working features.

- while some code knows that one's complement and sign-magnitude
  integers exist, it's unlikely that tools built for such a machine
  would actually work.
