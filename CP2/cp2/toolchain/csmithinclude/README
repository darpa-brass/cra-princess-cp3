This is a copy of the header files used by csmith output, for use
compiling the test programs.

It was generated (some of them are built) with ./configure && make on
an Ubuntu 16.04 machine; I then copied runtime/*.h here. It was built
from the same csmith 2.3.0 distribution that the test generator
container uses.
